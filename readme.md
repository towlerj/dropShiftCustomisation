This repo stores my cusotmisations to the Drop QMK repo. I didn't want to fork the entire repo, as I have a qmk repo forked already.

Changes include:
 - different default led settngs (i don't use the indicator leds, slower and less bright default, different pattern ordering).
  - my keymap (nothing that interesting: the numpad appears to have numlock by default, but really it isn't a numpad per se, the menu key is a layer chooser on hold, caps lock is double tap y, caps lock key is delete and layer on hold, keys map to similar to my drop alt, so nums are also function keys, etc...)
